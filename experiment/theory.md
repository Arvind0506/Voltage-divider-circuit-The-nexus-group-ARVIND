### THEORY
The voltage divider is a simple circuit used to reduce voltage using two resistors in series. The output voltage is taken from the junction of the two resistors.

Formula:

<p>
  <strong>V<sub>out</sub>= V<sub>in</sub>\times \frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2}

This formula shows that by adjusting the values of R1 and R2, the output voltage Vout can be varied proportionally.
