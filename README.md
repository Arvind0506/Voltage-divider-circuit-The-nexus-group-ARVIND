### About the Experiment 

This simulation demonstrates the working of a voltage divider circuit, a fundamental concept in electronics. A voltage divider uses two resistors (R1 and R2) connected in series across a DC power supply to generate a specific output voltage (Vout) that is a portion of the input voltage (Vin).

By adjusting the input voltage and resistor values using sliders, users can observe how the output voltage changes in real-time. The simulation visually represents the circuit using components like:
